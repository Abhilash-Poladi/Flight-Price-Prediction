Flight price prediction using Random Forest Regression ML model based on flight details like departure time, arrival time, airline company, number of stops.

Feature Engineering :

This dataset needs lot of feature engineering since it contains temporal variables and also categorical variables. We do one hot encoding to convert categorical variables to numerical variables.

Model and hyperparameter tuning :
We fit in Randomforestregressor and apply hyperparameter tuning to choose the best possible set of hyperparameters for the given dataset
